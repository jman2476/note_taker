  ## Features
  Make a note, type in the title and text, then hit the save button! Then you can delete that note, or save it, or eat your computer!

After taking a bunch of notes, try clicking on one that you wrote before! You can view your old notes, and then pet your cats.

Cats not included.

  ## Usage
  This app runs off of a free Render server at https://note-taker-3000.onrender.com/ so it may need some time to come online when you access it. It will also spin down after periods of no use.
